## Croatia, Jesuits, and the Latin school drama

In the Early Modern period, Croatia was part of the Kingdom of Hungary - the Kingdom of Croatia and Hungary, as Croatians would be quick to remind you (in 1102 the two kingdoms were united under one crown). Through the monarch, the kingdom was part of the Habsburg Empire. A multiethnic state, it retained Latin as its administrative, legal, and to some extent intellectual and even popular, *lingua franca*; the non-Magyar nations embraced the language both as a clearly not-Hungarian, and as a symbol of their "ancient political rights" -- which, in the case of Croatia, included rights to a certain level of autonomy. The regions that are modern Croatia, however, were in 17th and 18th century divided among the Habsburg Austrian lands, the Hungarian Kingdom, the Venetian Republic, and the tiny Republic of Dubrovnik.

In that region the Jesuit order was present from 1559, establishing colleges in the first third of the 17th century (Dubrovnik, Zagreb, Rijeka, Varaždin; Požega came later, in 1698). Jesuit colleges in Croatia were part of the Jesuit Austrian province.

## Why there was no research on Croatian Latin school drama until 2016

The Neo-Latin theatre in Croatia was not considered as a research subject at all until 2016. There are at least four reasons for the lack of interest. First, the theatre historians thought primarily about drama in the national language; second, they thought more about texts and their authors, and less about performances -- and there are few preserved texts of Neo-Latin theatre (or at least we *know* about a few texts), and they are anonymous; third, the literary historians valued originality and beauty -- in the tradition of Benedetto Croce -- over mere functionality and engagement; they considered "educational theatre" as something of inherently little aesthetic value. Finally, there were ideological obstacles: Latin was seen as language of the elite, of the ruling classes "estranged from the people", and the role of religious orders in educating the nation was admitted only grudgingly and with suspicion.

## Sources

Our main source of data, and a first inspiration to reconsider the phenomenon of Latin school drama in Croatia, was the fifth volume of the theatre bibliography by Martina Petranović and Lucija Ljubić, Repertoar hrvatskih kazališta : Knjiga peta : Deskriptivna obrada važnijih predstava na hrvatskom jeziku i izvedbi na stranim jezicima hrvatskih izvođača do 1840. godine (Zagreb 2012), which we supplemented and checked with data from Géza Staud, A magyarországi jezsuita iskolai színjátékok forrásai, III. : 1561-1773, Fontes ludorum scenicorum in scholis S. J. Hungariae, pars tertia (Budapest 1988). We were also able to compare the records with the chronicle of the Jesuit College in Zagreb, published in 1934-1937.

## Methods

From the data, we compiled an an XML database of testimonia on plays and performances. This compilation is different from other analyses of Croatian theatre repertoire because it can be reused more easily and for different purposes; our data itself and our data analyses do not remain in our notebooks, but are published on the internet; finally, the records can be enhanced and improved, new findings, keywords, corrections can be added. This process is also recorded by a version control system, a tool used routinely in software development, which records each set of changes.

The questions we ask from our data -- queries, in the programmers' jargon -- can themselves be published (they are part of our repository) -- and other researchers can both examine them and run them on our data, thus replicating our results, and rewrite them for their own purposes. In this way, our data can also be included in a larger collection -- one for the Jesuit Austrian Province, or even one for the whole Europe, or for the whole world.

## Findings

Our database holds records for 686 performances of plays in Latin. The majority of performances took place from 1607 to 1805. Most of the plays were performed in Jesuit colleges, especially in Zagreb (304), Varaždin (175), Rijeka (121), and Požega (69). All these colleges were part of the Jesuit Austrian Province. A more thorough general analysis of the repertoire will be given elsewhere, in Albacete, later this year.

Among the 686 performances, we find 18 (some 2.6 percent) where names of plays suggest that the theme has something to do with Japan. 

Here we must stress that our knowledge of Japan, of Christianity and Jesuits in Japan, and even of Japan on the Jesuit stage, is rudimentary; we see this conference as a chance to compare our findings with situation elsewhere. In that hope, we are proposing a first list of titles and themes -- some of them obviously distorted by a succession of chroniclers, editors, and compilers -- in the hope that we will find parallels in other parts of the Neo-Latin world.

The plays on Japan were performed during the 133 years between 1628 and 1761, in four cities, four Jesuit colleges: in Zagreb (established 1606), Varaždin (Jesuits present from 1632, college established 1678), Rijeka (college established 1627), and Požega (established 1698).

### A chronology of school plays on Japanese martyrs

1. Beginnings: Zagreb, 1628; 1677
2. The first wave: Varaždin 1713; Zagreb 1716; Zagreb 1720
3. Rijeka 1727
4. The second wave: Varaždin 1733, 1734 (2); Rijeka 1735; Požega 1735; Varaždin 1737
5. The third wave: Varaždin 1744; Rijeka 1747; Požega 1748; Zagreb 1750; Varaždin 1751
6. Ending: Zagreb 1761

### Testimonia from chronicles

A spectacle:

Zagreb, 1628: Diebus antecineralibus prodijt in theatrum Martyrium Joannis Ingori, filiorumque, in nouo orbe martyrium non ita pridem esse. Praemia.

With pleasing poetry:

Zagreb, 1677: Infima Japonicum adolescentem amoenissimis gratijs poëticis illustratum in scenam dedit.

Another spectacle:

Varaždin, 1713: Varasdini gloriatus uno de Ludovico Japoniae Martyre in quo Magistri, cujus nescio classis, industria nonnulla praemiola inter tubarum, tympanorumque fremitus. Praemia.


Good acting, well received:

Zagreb, 1716: Musae vero inferiores duabus potissimum actionibus drammaticis gloriantur, quarum alteram suprema et media classis grammatices exhibuit In triumpho crucis de Japone regulo et duobus filiis eius fortissimis fidei Christianae propugnatoribus. Tenuit illa mirifice spectatorum oculos ob vivacem adolescentum agendi modum in se defixos.

A model for the second-grade students:

Zagreb, 1720: Principistae exhibuerunt Phirandum Japonem Christianum principistam fidei rudimenta sangvine et vita defendere paratum.

First and second grade together:

Varaždin, 1733: Principia Elementari juncta Ludovicum Nangasachensem de victo Galbanutio et Idololatria triumphantem exhibuit.

## Conclusions

In Croatia, the Jesuit school drama, especially in its Latin variety, has until recently been disregarded as a research subject. The texts were missing, therefore -- the literary scholars concluded -- they were not of any value or interest; they were "just pedagogy". The general historians were more interested in political developments, and had little time for any form of "culture". On the other hand, the Jesuits writing their *Ordensgeschichte* were interested in the order as an institution; its pedagogical activity was duly praised, but it received little actual or critical analysis. 

When subject matter of the school plays was considered in Croatian history at all, the pride of place went to the "nationalist" or "proto-nationalist" themes -- the nation being, of course, the modern Croatian nation, as it was to be imagined in the 1830s.

In our opinion, the Jesuit theatre is important because it offered to virtually all Croatian intellectuals in the 17th and 18th century a chance to perform in front of an audience. Theatre, and experience of performance, was part of the education, and, if we want to understand that past on its own terms, we must try to understand this fact and its implications.

Moreover, the thematic focus of the school theatre was not limited to one's own country and one's own nation, wherever its borderlines; the Jesuit interest for Japan is interest for modernity, although expressed in the language of Cicero and Saint Jerome. The fact that such interest was present, and nurtured, even in a small Slavic people living at the periphery of the Habsburg Empire, means that the horizons were wider than we are ready to admit today.
